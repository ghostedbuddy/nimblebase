# NimbleBase File System Storage Strategy
NimbleBase could employ a hybrid approach that combines memory-efficient data structures with disk-based storage to manage its data on the file system without loading the entire database into memory. The following methodology details how NimbleBase might accomplish this:

1. **Chunked Data Files:** Organize the data into smaller, manageable files or 'chunks'. This allows for only portions of data relevant to a query to be loaded into memory at any given time.
2. **Indexing Mechanism:** Use tokenization and indexing techniques to create a map of data locations within the chunks. Index files can quickly direct the system to the exact chunk needed without scanning all the data.
3. **Caching Layer:** Implement a caching system to temporarily hold frequently accessed data in memory for fast retrieval, reducing disk access overhead.
4. **Write-Ahead Logging (WAL):** Record changes in a log before applying them to the database files. This ensures durability and aids in recovery processes.
5. **Concurrency Control:** To allow multiple processes to efficiently and safely interact with the data, implement mechanisms like Multi-Version Concurrency Control (MVCC) or lock-based strategies, depending on the level of concurrency needed.

By using such strategies, NimbleBase can be designed to offer scalability and high performance while maintaining the flexibility to handle growing amounts of data as projects evolve.

## Important Notes and Thoughts

### Database File System Handling in Established Systems
Established databases handle data storage on the file system through well-defined methodologies to ensure data integrity, performance, and scalability. Here's how some common strategies work:

1. **Database Files and Tablespaces**: Databases like PostgreSQL store data in tables which are grouped into tablespaces. These tablespaces are essentially logical storage units that correspond to physical files or directories on disk, allowing for organized data storage and management.

2. **Data Pages**: Data is stored in fixed-size blocks or 'pages'. For example, PostgreSQL uses 8KB pages by default. When a database operation occurs, only the relevant pages are read into memory, not the entire database, ensuring efficient use of resources.

3. **Indexing**: Systems use B-Trees or other indexing algorithms to create indexes, which map key values to their corresponding location in the database files. Indexes enable quick data retrieval without scanning entire tables.

4. **Transaction Logs**: Transaction logs (like WAL in PostgreSQL) record all changes to the database before they are written to the actual data files. This aids in crash recovery and ensures ACID compliance.

5. **Buffer Pool**: A buffer pool is used to cache data pages in memory. This reduces disk I/O by keeping frequently accessed data readily available in memory.

6. **Concurrency and Locking**: Concurrency control is achieved using various locking mechanisms (row-level, table-level) or through MVCC, where each transaction works with a snapshot of data, permitting multiple concurrent reads and writes.

7. **Write Strategies**: Write strategies such as grouping writes or delayed writing can enhance performance by reducing disk write operations.
